Performance Optimizations

Implement data caching:

Cache DynamoDB responses

Cache expensive calculations

Add session state management

Optimize DynamoDB queries:

Use pagination

Implement parallel processing for large datasets

Add data preprocessing

Feature Enhancements

Advanced filtering options

Data export functionality

More interactive visualizations

Real-time data updates

Custom date range selection

User preferences saving

Security Improvements

Input validation

AWS credentials management

Data sanitization

Error handling

Audit logging

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these improvements or focus on implementing a specific enhancement? We can start with the area that would provide the most immediate value to your application.

Also, I notice you're using AWS services - would you like to explore integrating additional AWS services to enhance the application's capabilities? For example:

AWS CloudWatch for monitoring

AWS S3 for data storage

AWS Lambda for background processing

AWS ElastiCache for caching

Let me know which direction you'd like to explore first
